### Creating New CV-Playground Applications on Databricks Examples
- Please review [REPO_structure.md](REPO_structure.md) before getting started.

- For contributors developing new CV Applications examples, create a new folder under `notebooks/` and place all related files inside that folder.

- Include a `README.md` specific to your cv-playground application that explains:

   1. Project use case, purpose, and functionality

   1. Installation and/or Setup instructions

   1. Usage examples

### Coding and Testing
- All contributions must be tested and code reviewed before merging into dev or main.

- If your work is in-progress or not fully tested, keep it in a separate feature branch until it’s ready for review.

### Adding Dependencies
- If your utility introduces new libraries, include the library name, version, copyright, and source in the repository’s main [README.md](README.md).

- Libraries that are not open-source must go through legal review before inclusion.

### Submitting Contributions
- Clone the repository and create a new branch (e.g., feature/your-cv-application-name).

- Commit descriptive changes with clear messages.

- Push your branch and open a pull request targeting dev.

- Request a review before merging.

- Repeat for main branch, which is protected, requiring an approving review before a successful merge.

### Code Style and Documentation
- Follow the existing code style standards used in the repository.

- Keep commit messages concise yet meaningful.

- Ensure all documentation and examples are up to date.
